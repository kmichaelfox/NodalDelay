## Generative Node-based Delay Line for Max/MSP

### Description
This was a project commissioned by Nicholas DeMaison, director of the Rensselaer Orchestra at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The project was to generate a live electronic system to complement the orchestra's performance of Pauline Oliveros' piece, Four Meditations for Orchestra: Movement III - Interdependence.

The electronics generated consisted of a generative node-based markov chain delay line which complemented the rhythmic dynamism and complexity of Oliveros' piece.

The performance of the piece featuring the electronics can be heard __[here](http://soundcloud.com/kmichaelfox/rensselaer-orchestra-four)__.

For the performance of this piece, the delay line was set up for spatialization in 10 channels in a concert hall at __[EMPAC](http://empac.rpi.edu/)__. The delay line can be refigured for any number of channels or nodes by relatively superficial edits to the two Max patches provided.
